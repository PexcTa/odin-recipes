    <h1>GRILLED CHEESE RECIPE</h1>
    <img src="../images/gc.jpg" alt="Picture of Delicious Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Cheese flowing out of it">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A grilled cheese sandwich is a fantastic meal for any occasion. It's crunchy on the outside and 
        full of hot molten goodness on the inside. A true grilled cheese includes nothing but bread, cheese and butter; 
        variations with any other fillings should be referred to as <em>melts</em>.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>You will need:
        <li>Wheat Bread of your favorite variety - 2 slices per sandwich</li>
        <li>100 g cheese per sandwich (we recommend Mild Wisconsin Cheddar)</li>
        <li>1 tsp butter</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare a frying pan and preheat it on mid-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the butter to the pan.</li>
        <li>While the butter is melting, slice the cheese and arrange it on a slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Cover the cheese with the other slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Carefully put the sandwich into the pan and fry it in butter on one side.</li>
        <li>In about 2 minutes, the bread should be golden brown and the cheese should start melting. Flip the sandwich.</li>
        <li>Fry on the other side for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take the sandwich off the pan. If desired, cut it down the center to get a pretty picture like ours.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious grilled cheese! Tell your friends!</li>
    </ol>
