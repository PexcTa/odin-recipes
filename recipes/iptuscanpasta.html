    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>You will need:
        <li>1 carton of chicken broth (low-sodium)</li>
        <li>1 pound of chicken breast, thin-sliced</li>
        <li>1 bag of baby spinach</li>
        <li>8 oz of cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup of shredded parmesan</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of sun-dried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, Italian herbs</li>
        <li>12 oz of pasta of your choice - Boris recommends Farfalle</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>In the Instant Pot, combine the sun-dried tomatoes, chicken, chicken broth and spices</li>
       <li>Stir in all the pasta.</li>
       <li>Set to cook for 8 minutes on high pressure with quick release.</li>
       <li>Play some Guilty Gear: STRIVE while it cooks. Sponsored by Guilty Gear: STRIVE.</li>
       <li>When this is done cooking, stir in the cream cheese, cubed in advance so it melts faster.</li>
       <li>Once the cream cheese is blended into the dish, add spinach in portions - it will shrink as it cooks from residual heat.</li>
       <li>Finally, serve with grated parmesan sprinkled over it.</li>
    </ol>
