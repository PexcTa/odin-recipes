    <h1>Steak Recipe - At Home!</h1>
    <img src="../images/steak.jpg" alt="Meaty, bloody, seared steak.">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Look, I get it, steakhouses are expensive. It's quite dumb when you think about it; the 
        beef industry is only surviving because of McDonalds and state subsidies and at the same time
        it's one of the biggest contributors to global warming. Red meat isn't too good for you, either.
        By the way, you should know that poor communities are disproportionately affected by global warming 
        and therefore the beef industry is playing a substantial part in the eternal class war. But you
        are probably here only for the steak recipe, so let me show you how to get this bad boy
        all tasty a juicy while only armed with an oven, a range, and a cast iron pan. Please don't do This
        in some piece of Tefal bullshit.
    </p>
